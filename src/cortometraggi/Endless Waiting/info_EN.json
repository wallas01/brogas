    "SINOSSI": "A woman in her twelfth month of pregnancy is unable to give birth. To finally be able to hug her baby, she decides to travel, together with a new-age midwife, to meet a shaman who lives isolated in the woods. The road, the fatigue, the misunderstandings with the elderly midwife - due to the woman's secret of having gotten pregnant by a bear - force her to face herself, her limits and the decision of whether to continue her research alone, or go back. In the dense and dark wood, something attracts and terrifies her at the same time. Her session with the shaman, a dark and mysterious man, reveals that the reason why the child hasn’t been born yet is hidden in her fears. One in particular.",
