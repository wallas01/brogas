    "LOGLINE" :"A kid is lost at sea during a storm. Despite the decision of the town’s adults to call off the search, his friends won’t give up and decide to build a CB radio to track him down.",
    "SINOSSI": "In Italy's deep south there is a place where, on clear days, you can get a glimpse of the Greek mountains of Othonoi Island from across the sea. Here, in the hot summer, five kids fall off a cliff into the sea during a big storm. The oldest, Pati, gets lost among the waves. Days later, the town’s adults decide to call off the search. The kids, however, do not give up and, certain that their friend managed to reach the Greek coast, they build a CB radio in the wreck of an old car to contact him. After many attempts, amidst the radio waves and the voices of their hope, they are finally able to detect their friend’s distorted whistling, and a Greek voice calling to them: - “Onda ranne” (“The big wave”) can you hear me? -",
